# 🤖 Minecraft AFK Bot (Mineflayer-Based)

This is a lightweight Minecraft Java AFK Bot powered by [Mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer). It connects to a Java server, performs basic movements to avoid AFK detection, and can be customized via a simple configuration file.

---

## ⚠️ Warning Before You Begin

- Before starting the bot, please make sure that the Offline Mode (Pirated/Not Original) option in the settings section of your Aternos server is active.

- Secure the bot to protect it from monsters in the game.

---

## ✨ Features

* Connect to Minecraft Java servers (IP + port)
* Customize bot username
* Control chunk loading and memory usage
* Periodic chunk pruning to reduce resource usage
* Auto-movement behavior: step forward/backward, jump, sneak, loop
* Easy configuration via `config.json`

## 🤖 Starting the Bot

```bash
node bot.js

## ⚙️ Configuration Options (`config.json`)

| Key            | Description                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `serverHost`         | IP or domain of your Minecraft server      |
| `serverPort`         | Server port (default is 25565)             |

| `botChunk` | Radius of loaded chunks (recommended: 1–6) |

## ⚠️ Notes

* **Skins**: Skins might not appear properly if the server is in offline mode.
* **Sneak Movement**: The bot uses `setControlState('sneak', true)`, but some servers may block or ignore this action.
* **AFK Prevention**: The bot periodically moves, sneaks, and jumps to prevent disconnection due to inactivity.
